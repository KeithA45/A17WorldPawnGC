# A17WorldPawnGC
RimWorld mod I made, because I REALLY like this game

Cleans up unimportant, unwanted worldpawns, improving performance in long running saves. Sometimes reduces save file size as well.

Modified and released (with permission) from Zhentar's mod "WorldPawnGC" to be A17 compatible.

Can be added/removed from existing saves without issues.
